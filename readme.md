# M223 Waiter Application Client

This is the Client of my application. It was realized with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction) and uses a caddy reverse proxy. 

## Getting Started

First, install [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if it's not already installed.

When installed, the caddyserver can be started by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
caddy
```

Then install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To start the client, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) (and not localhost:3333) to start browsing.
